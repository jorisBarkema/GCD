# GCD
The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers p and q is the greatest number which is a divisor of both of the numbers. The oldest known algorithm to calculate the GCD is Euclid's algorithm, but faster algorithms are still being developed. This project implements Euclid's algorithm and Stein's binary GCD algorithm, as well as an extended version of Euclid's algorithm and a new extended version of Stein's algorithm.

The extended versions return the Bézout coëfficients along with the GCD. The Bézout coëfficients are used to find multiplicative inverse elements in modular arithmetic. An important application is calculating the private key in the public-key cryptosystem RSA
